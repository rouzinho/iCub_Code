This is the code of iCub taking an object and placing it in a special area. This is a set up demo of what my experiment should looks like.
The purpose is to use reinforcement learning to learn taking object and place them in a special area.
Then I will use Transfer Learning to transfer the skill of placing the object to a pointing gesture.

Unfortunatly, the work is not in progress anymore.
Video of the set up experiment in this current folder.
